        <p>   I was recently approached by an avid user of an embroidery machine looking for an easier way to
        edit the file names of custom fonts they were using. I created a program to rename each file in a specified directory by taking 
        the first letter of each name and adding that character to the end of the file. This enables the font to be loaded into
        <a href="https://inkstitch.org/"> Inkscape/stitch</a>  to be aligned. This greatly reduces the time needed when importing new fonts 
        as you are able to rename ~62 files for each size of said font in as little as 3 clicks.
        </p>
        <p>You can download the program for this here: <a href="https://github.com/KyleSiegwarth"> Github</a></p>
